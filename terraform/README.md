# CyberRange Terraform 

## Booting up
To bootup the range you need to perform the following steps:
1 - clone the project & perform the [basic setup guide]():
2 - terraform apply
3 - awsnuke to destroy


##  Overview 
This started as an unofficial fork of the [terraform-with-circleci-example](https://github.com/fedekau/terraform-with-circleci-example).  Then quickly evolved into a cloud-based SecDevOps penTesting lab.

The simple goal is to create an open-source repository of vulernable targets which 
provide the security researcher with the scalability, performance, and 
elastic compute of the cloud.
