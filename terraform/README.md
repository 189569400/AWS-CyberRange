# Overview
This started as an unofficial fork of the terraform-with-circleci-example
and was enhanced to create a SecDevOps penTesting lab of cloud targets.

The simple goal is to create an open-source repository of targets which 
aid the common researcher and leverages the elastic compute potential of 
the cloud
