# Cyber Range
## Overview
This aims to provide a simple setup for a reproducible offensive security lab.

It enables researchers to setup assets quickly, maintain manifests of common
setups, and deploy locally or to the AWS cloud with the flip of a configuration
setup.

The goal here is to run terraform/vagrant/docker and automate the
provisioning of assets for a penetration tester, ethical hacker, &
aspiring cyber security engineers.

Recognition is key for community success therefore all credit to tools,
influencer's, and forks were added to the credits.md  Don't shy away


##
This is simply an AWS-based solution for a PenTester.  The goal is to
provide a cloud penTesting environment with within minutes.

Todo that, I've created 8 AMI's in us-east-1 which are currently private.

I've implemented aws-nuke and successfully purged all undesired resources from multiple regions.

This project will evolve into the SecDevOPs-Cuse toolkit... stay tuned.
